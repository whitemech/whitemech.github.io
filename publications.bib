abstract = {Although current languages used in ontology-based data access (OBDA) systems allow for mapping source data
to instances of concepts and relations in the ontology, several application domains need more flexible tools for
inferring knowledge from data, which are able to dynamically acquire axioms about new concepts and relations directly
from the data. In this paper we introduce the notion of mapping-based knowledge base (MKB) to formalize the situation
where both the extensional and the intensional level of the ontology are determined by suitable mappings to a set of
data sources. This allows for making the intensional level of the ontology as dynamic as the extensional level
traditionally is. To do so, we resort to the meta-modeling capabilities of higher-order description logics, in
particular the description logic Hi(DL-Lite R), which allows seeing concepts and relations as individuals,
and vice versa. The challenge in this setting is to design efficient algorithms for answering queries posed to MKBs.
Besides the definition of MKBs, our main contribution is to prove that answering instance queries posed to MKBs
expressed in Hi(DL-Lite R) can be done efficiently.},
