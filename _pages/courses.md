### Abstract

This course introduces AI planning and program synthesis for tasks (goals) expressed over finite traces, instead of states. Specifically, borrowing from Formal Methods we will consider tasks and environment specifications expressed in LTL, as well as its finite trace variant LTLf.  We will review the main results and algorithmic techniques to handle planning in nondeterministic domains. Then, we will draw connections with verification, reactive synthesis in particular, together with their game-theoretic solution techniques. The main catch is that working with these logics can be based on devising suitable 2-players games and finding strategies, i.e., plans, to win them.
Specifically we will cover the following topics: Planning in nondeterministic domain, Temporal Logics, LTL, LTLf, Game-theoretic Techniques, Safety Games, Reachability Games, Games for LTL/LTLf objectives, Reactive Synthesis. This course is partially based on the work carried out in ERC Advanced Grant WhiteMech.

### Course content

<!-- ###### Planning -->
<b>Planning</b>:
Introduction to planning. Fixpoint calculations. Deterministic and nondeterministc domains. Planning with temporally extended goals. LTLf: linear-time temporal logic over finite traces. From LTLf o finite automata. Deterministic and nondeterministc domains with LTLf goals.

<!-- ###### Synthesis -->
<b>Linear Temporal Logic</b>: Logic based language for the representation of programs. Model checking with LTL. The Synthesis problem with LTL goals. Automata-theoretic approach to Model Checking and Synthesis.

<!-- ###### Games -->
<b>Games</b>:
Introduction to 2-player (turn-based) games on graphs and their relatioship with Planning and Synthesis. Solutions to simple objective games: Reachability, Safety, Safe-Reach, Buchi Games.
Parity games: a more sophisticated game objective. Solution to parity games and their relationship with LTL synthesis.

<!-- ###### Synthesis under assumptions -->
<b>Synthesis under assumptions</b>:
The environment represented as an LTL specification. The synthesis under assumption solved as synthesis of an implication formula. Direct and more effective solutions to the synthesis under assumption for notable cases of LTLf formulas: Safety, Safety & coSafety, Safety & Fairness, Safety & Stability, Safety & GR(1). Symbolic representation and techniques for Planning and Synthesis
