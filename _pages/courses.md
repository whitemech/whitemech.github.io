### Abstract

This course introduces AI planning and program synthesis for tasks (goals) expressed over finite traces, instead of states. Specifically, borrowing from Formal Methods we will consider tasks and environment specifications expressed in LTL, as well as its finite trace variant LTLf.  We will review the main results and algorithmic techniques to handle planning in nondeterministic domains. Then, we will draw connections with verification, reactive synthesis in particular, together with their game-theoretic solution techniques. The main catch is that working with these logics can be based on devising suitable 2-players games and finding strategies, i.e., plans, to win them.
Specifically we will cover the following topics: Planning in nondeterministic domain, Temporal Logics, LTL, LTLf, Game-theoretic Techniques, Safety Games, Reachability Games, Games for LTL/LTLf objectives, Reactive Synthesis. This course is partially based on the work carried out in ERC Advanced Grant WhiteMech.
