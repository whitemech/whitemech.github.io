### Context.
<p class="text-justify">
We are witnessing an increasing availability of mechanisms that offer form of programmability. These mechanisms are currently being revolutionized by advancements in sensing (vision, language understanding) and actuation components (autonomous mobile manipulators, automated storage and retrieval systems). However, such mechanisms are held back by the fact that their logic is still based on hard-wired rules encoded in hand-crafted programs.
</p>
### How.
<p class="text-justify">
Recent discoveries in Knowledge Representation, Reasoning about Actions and Planning, and Reinforcement Learning in Artificial Intelligence, and their connections to Verification and Synthesis in Formal Methods, and Data-Aware Processes in Databases, chart an novel path to produce a breakthrough.
</p>
### Driving Applications.
<p class="text-justify">
WhiteMech will ground its scientific results upon three driving applications: smart manufacturing (Industry 4.0), smart spaces (IoT) and business process management systems (BPM).
</p>
We are located at Sapienza University.
