# Research
<p class="text-justify">
The project WhiteMech (White-Box Self-Programming Mechanisms) addresses 
the study and development of artificial intelligence systems that are 
capable of independently reprogramming themselves to achieve new 
objectives, in reaction to unexpected changes, and conform to the 
evolution of human rules and agreements in specific contexts. In 
particular, the objective is to develop systems that are "white-box 
by design‚Äù, meaning that they can be interrogated, analysed and 
managed, at any moment, in terms comprehensible to human beings, to 
decrease the risk implicit in a self-programming system. The 
parallel research activities address the application of these 
systems in smart manufacturing (Industry 4.0), smart spaces (
Internet of Things) and robotic automation processes (Business 
Process Management).

In order to reach this objective, the study will also address 
subjects that are transversal to artificial intelligence including 
the representation of understanding, automatic reasoning and planning
, and reinforcement learning, as well as formal methods, such as the 
assessment and automatic development of programmes, and data 
management, including the analysis and synthesis of data-aware 
processes.

## Context
<p class="text-justify">
We are witnessing an increasing availability of mechanisms that offer form of programmability. 
These mechanisms are currently being revolutionized by advancements in sensing (vision, language 
understanding) and actuation components (autonomous mobile manipulators, automated storage and 
retrieval systems). However, such mechanisms are held back by the fact that their logic is still 
based on hard-wired rules encoded in hand-crafted programs.
</p>

## How
<p class="text-justify">
Recent discoveries in Knowledge Representation, Reasoning about Actions and Planning, and 
Reinforcement Learning in Artificial Intelligence, and their connections to Verification and 
Synthesis in Formal Methods, and Data-Aware Processes in Databases, chart an novel path to 
produce a breakthrough.
</p>

## Driving Applications
<p class="text-justify">
WhiteMech will ground its scientific results upon three driving applications: smart 
manufacturing (Industry 4.0), smart spaces (IoT) and business process management systems (BPM).
