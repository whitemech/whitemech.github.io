#### Abstract
Goal recognition is the problem of recognizing the intended goal of autonomous agents or humans by observing their
behavior in an environment. Over the past years, most existing approaches to goal and plan recognition have been
ignoring the need to deal with imperfections regarding the domain model that formalizes the environment where
autonomous agents behave. In this thesis, we introduce the problem of goal recognition over imperfect domain models,
and develop solution approaches that explicitly deal with two distinct types of imperfect domains models: (1)
incomplete discrete domain models that have possible, rather than known, preconditions and effects in action
descriptions; and (2) approximate continuous domain models, where the transition function is approximated from past
observations and not well-defined. We develop novel goal recognition approaches over imperfect domains models by
leveraging and adapting existing recognition approaches from the literature. Experiments and evaluation over these
two types of imperfect domains models show that our novel goal recognition approaches are accurate in comparison to
baseline approaches from the literature, at several levels of observability and imperfections.
