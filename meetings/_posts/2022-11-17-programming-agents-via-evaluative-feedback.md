**When**:  Thursday, November 17, 2022, 4:30pm (CET).

**Where**: Zoom online.

**Topic**: Programming Agents via Evaluative Feedback.

**Speaker**: [Michael Littiman](https://www.littmania.com/), computer science professor at Brown University.

#### Abstract

Reinforcement-learning agents optimize their behavior from evaluative feedback. This talk focuses on how we're improving reinforcement-learning algorithms by building a better understanding of how people can provide this feedback through telling, training, and teaching. Specifically, it will cover linear temporal logic as a task representation, arguing that traditional rewards can make behaviors difficult to express. It will also summarize work that attempts to characterize the ways human users deliver evaluative feedback and novel algorithms that can use this feedback effectively as a way of enabling end-user training of AI systems.
