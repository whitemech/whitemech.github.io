#### Abstract

In this talk, we outline Business Process Management and its applications in various fields (including smart manufacturing) and we attempt to build a bridge with AI, KR and formal methods approaches. In particular, starting from the outline of some research results of the speaker(s), we will build a kind of brainstorming in which novel ideas on how to improve BPM with methods taken from AI, towards the vision of a smart BPM, will be shown and discussed.
