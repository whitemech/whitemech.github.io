#### Abstract

Decomposition is a commonly used technique in various algorithms in formal methods. When we observe systems that
describe a relation between inputs and outputs, a decomposition, or separation, of the system to input and output
components seems only natural. Specifically in synthesis, where the challenge is to construct a strategy or a function
that is essentially from inputs to outputs. But what sense does it really make? After all, the specification given by
the user, is intended to describe an involved relation between the input and output parts. As such, the algorithms
obtained so far are designed to exploit this tight correspondence between inputs and outputs towards strategy
generation. In this talk I show how we use input/output separation for synthesis in both areas of Boolean functional
synthesis and reactive synthesis. For Boolean functional synthesis I describe how to separate every Boolean formula to
input and output components. In reactive synthesis I describe applications in which it is natural for the designer to
write specifications that separate inputs and outputs. For both areas, I show how to exploit this separation towards
more efficient synthesis algorithms. This talk is based on joint works with Gal Amram, Suguman Bansal, Supratick
Chackraborty, Lucas Tabajara, Moshe Vardi, and Gera Weiss.
