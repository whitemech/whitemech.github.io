#### Abstract

In game theory, as well as in the semantics of game logics, a strategy can be represented by any function from states of
the game to the agent’s actions. That makes sense from the mathematical point of view, but not necessarily in the
context of human behavior. This is because humans are quite bad at executing complex plans, and also rather unlikely to
come up with such plans in the first place. In this work, we adopt the view of bounded rationality, and look only at "
simple" strategies in specifications of agents’ abilities. We formally define what "simple" means, and propose a variant
of alternating-time temporal logic that takes only such strategies into account. We also study the model checking
problem for the resulting semantics of ability.

#### Short Bio

Vadim Malvone is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Networks department (INFRES) of Télécom Paris. From November
2017 to June 2020, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Evry under the supervision of Francesco
Belardinelli. In February 2018, he obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Naples "Federico II", with
a thesis titled "Strategic Reasoning in Game Theory", developed under the supervision of Aniello Murano. During his Ph.D.
program, he was a visiting researcher at the Polish Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Wojtek Jamroga. In July
2014, Vadim obtained his Master's degree in Computer Science, with a thesis titled "Graded modalities in strategic reasoning"
, developed under the supervision of Aniello Murano and Fabio Mogavero.
