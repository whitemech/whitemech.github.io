#### Abstract

The plan/activity/intention/goal recognition problem is the task of identifying an agent’s intent by observing its
behaviour. Traditionally, the problem has involved matching a sequence of observations to a plan in a pre-defined plan
library;the winning plan being the one that "best" matches the observations. Recent developments dispense with the
overhead of a plan library and instead---based on the assumption that the observed agent is behaving rationally---take a
cost-based approach and use classical planning technology to generate candidate plans as needed over a domain model. In
this talk, we will review this cost-based approach to goal recognition and some recent results, both for general task
planning and path planning. We will present a preliminary framework of deception, and techniques to handle irrational
and deceptive agents when performing goal recognition.

This is a summary of a stream of work done together with Dr. Peta Masters (now at Melbourne University) and has appeared
at AAMAS'17, IJCAI'17, JAIR'18, AAMAS'19 and AIJ'21.
